# LoadAlready!

Tired of the loading bug and just want a simple way to get rid of the indicator? Just use LoadAlready!
This is a [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod that lets you double-click the loading indicator to remove it if the loading bug occurs so you can just load already!
